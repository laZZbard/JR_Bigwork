2023 Computer Software Basis Big Work
This Big Work requests us to forecast the fight flow of Frankfull Airport according to the data. And I'm in charge of the Map-API and Flight route display.

This repository includes the process of my learning of ArcGIS API and Baidu API. Also the final HTML file.

If you have any questions about it, feel free to contact with me.

And if you want to quotate it, please respect its copyright.

**THANK YOU!**
